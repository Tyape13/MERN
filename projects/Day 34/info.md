### 1 - REST (Representational State Transfer)
REST is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. 
REST is really important concept. 
we have learned about api, how to get/post request. 
now for RESTFUL api, let's learn k k xa.

she talks about a project, where she made quora type website, where we edit post, write post or delete post and dynamic content xa and actively change hune frontend according to users. 

REST is not a package, it's just RULES??? Really??? just rules. Ok.
restful api is used for CRUD, create read update delete, this is main concept in database. 

she says, just for good practice. we do these things. we don't go to /users/delete rather create delete request for /users or things like this.

### 2 - CRUD Operations
GET - retrives resources
POST - submit new data to server
PUT - update existing data COMPLETELY
PATCH - update only 1 or 2 things in data partially
DELETE - removes data


### 3 - Creating RESTful Apis
GET: /posts - to get data for all posts
POST: /posts - to add a new post
GET: /posts/:id - to get one post(using id)
PATCH: /posts/:id - to update specific post
DELETE: /posts/:id - to delete specific post

we done some progress in project

### 4 - Index Route
we put NOUN in routes than VERBS(action word). like post and not view_posts. 
i had to "npm install ejs". 


### 5 - 
Before Writing Code, we usually make Architecture, posts/new haru zasto use garera for one action,
and different path for different paths.
