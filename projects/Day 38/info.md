I don't know bro i need to learn Postgresql and not Mern cause MERN is Expensive when storage gets larger. 

NO I need to understand fundamentals, I haven't completely learned SQL ONLY, aru sabai i m going to do. 
project starts from 41-56. 
I m going to complete it, then only i m moving on cause i will have better knowledge of UNKNOWNS and Understood Fundamentals in this so it can be applied to other languages too.
