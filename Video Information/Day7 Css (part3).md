Ok Let's Start to learn. 
This is more about Intermediate Css Stuff. 

in first video i was supposed to download html file. that's it

### 2 - Box Model
Height, width, border, padding, margin.

### 3 -  Height and Width
when we set height, 
it's just about Content ko Height, and Width. 
I think height and width is smaller part inside whole box itself. 

### 4 - Border Property
border-width: 5px;
border-style: solid;
border: 2px solid black;
I only write New concepts.

### 5 - Border-Radius Property
Curved Edges Square Boxes/Borders.  
border-radius:50%;
or (14px)

### 6 - Padding Property
Spaces outside Content, Bubble Wrapper.
padding: 1px 2px;
// top & bottom | right & left.
padding: 1px 2px 3px;
// top | left & right | bottom
padding: 1px 2px 3px 4px;
// top | right | bottom | left
- It goes Clockwise direction to apply the padding effects.

### 7 - Margin Property
BROOO, To Control Space Between 2 Content Sections/Boxes.
Concept to Understand.
Same Mathi ko zastai concept can be used here. 
margin changed for block elements like div won't change any right side margin cause div occupies all right side and it's not inline element

### 8 - Practice Qs
just traffic lights made with divs

### 9 - Display Property
This is Gonna Be Great Concept. (No Flexbox i think, idk we just saw inline/block)
- products that are placed right beside each other are inline elements and not block cause they take entire block
- display: inline;
- display: block;
bro it makes even div inline??????????????
YES!
Some Interesting Thing:
- when Padding, Margin implementing on Inline Elements. it will only affect Left and Right. 
- when Padding, Margin on Block (div) Elements. It affects everywhere. for some reason.

### 10 - Something Random
idk bro pdf thyo

### 11 - Inline Block
