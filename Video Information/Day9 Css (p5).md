SERIOUSLY LOCKING THE FUCK IN.

Concept Building and Learning ma Focused, NOT READING OR REMEMBERING. 
Rather LEARNING and Understanding Stronger.
cause Too Many things xa just in Flexbox. we can always Search.

### 1 - FlexBox (REALLY IMPORTANT)
one-dimentional layout method 
This makes the Website RESPONSIVE

first video just one concept.
Imagine a Container having imaginary lines vertical and horizontal from center.

when Row is Set Main Axis. y-axis will be Cross axis 
when Column is Set Main Axis. x-axis will be Cross axis


### 2 - Display Flex
We Supposed to make 'display:flex;' for Container not the actual content itself but the container is Display= Flex;
it will Restrict Things into Container, 
You Product can't Overflow. Overflow??? OVERFLOWWW.....hmmmm

### 3 - Flex Direction
flexbox-direction: row; // main axis, left to right
flexbox-direction: row-reverse; // main axis, right to left
flexbox-direction: column; // main axis, top to bottom
flexbox-direction: column-reverse; // main axis, bottom to top

this is it. 
I think we use 'row' the most. THE MOST.

### 4 - Justify Content
to control Mechanism of how Space is Distributed.
justify-content: flex-start;
justify-content: flex-end;
justify-content: center;
i don't want to go that much in depth cause Tailwind.

justify-content: space-between; // space comes in between, no right/left
justify-content: space-around; //  space comes around Div card, middle ma double than extreme sides
justify-content: space-evenly; // space around everywhere same... Elegant Design

### 5 - Flex Wrap
!IMPORTANT
flex-wrap: nowrap; // default
flex-wrap: wrap; // wrap.... MAGIC it's Magic. lalalalallalala ok Me Mature ...who cares.... lalalalalalal
flex-wrap: wrap-reverse; // cross axis ko according and in reverse direction. damn saab ulto.

flexbox tried to squish everything in 1 single row/column.
this wrapping mechanism is kinda cool.
wrap means they will have their original height/width n rather go to next line.

### 6 - Align Items
I have no idea bro.. k k vanyo. 
i don't think this important so moving on.


### 7 - Align Content
Ok Bruh. She saying that we need to practice by doing not by looking at video.
ka? sigh*
I just need fundamental concept of how to implement.
and k k exits garxa like how Margin works and what padding is, was great help.

IF I NEED, I will master FLEXBOX everything about this. IF I NEED!!!

### 8 - Align Self
this is stronger align items but to control Individual.

### 9 - Flex Sizing
.....i need to skip rather quick scan not imp contents cause Not Necessary for Me.

### 10 - Flex Shorthand
i don't care brothaaaaa. I donttt.
