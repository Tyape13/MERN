Ok this is huge. let's get started.
I need basics of Js before TS.

###  1 - Intro
i know

### 2 - console in browser stuff
not important

### 3 - variables.
yeah

### 4 - Datatypes (7 main types)
number
boolean
string
Undefined
null
bigint 
Symbol

### 5 - Numbers
there is no explicit type called float or int or negative, idk about double

### 6 - Operators
Modulo - % (this gives remaineder)
Exponentiation - **
Yeah this is pretty simple.
