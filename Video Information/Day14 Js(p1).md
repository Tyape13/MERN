Ok this is huge. let's get started.
I need basics of Js before TS.

###  1 - Intro
i know

### 2 - console in browser stuff
not important

### 3 - variables.
yeah

### 4 - Datatypes (7 main types)
number
boolean
string
Undefined
null
bigint 
Symbol

### 5 - Numbers
there is no explicit type called float or int or negative, idk about double

### 6 - Operators
Modulo - % (this gives remaineder)
Exponentiation - **
Yeah this is pretty simple.


### 7 - NaN in Js
Not-A-Number
NaN is a Number Type, it is depiction of No Number like 0/0.

### 8 - Operator Precendence
BODMAS Rule
() - Bracket
** - Exponential
*, /, %
+, -


### 9 - 'let', 'const', 'var' Keywords
how we initialize variables.
let b;
or
const pi; // i don't think we can change value of this variable.

var is old syntax, we use let. 
no need to even think about var. cause it's Far too old.


### 10 - Assignment Operators
= 
+= 
-=
*=
/=

idk about others.

### 11 = Unary Operators
I dont need to know This FANCY TOPICS.
it's just
a++
b--
i know these concepts. no need to know the name like blah blah.

pre:
--a
post:
a--

I think while loop ma teti matter gardaina but but but
when we assing to new variable then BUGSSSS.. RUNNNNNN

let newNum = a++;
hehehahahaha, newNum will have a ko value then a will get incremented to 1+.
i think idk not tried bro.

so use
let newNum2 = ++a;
nice.


### 12 - Practicing Above Concepts

### 13 - Identifiers Rules
naming rules. 
we can use (a, A, 1, _, $) no space allowed inbetween names. I KNOW BRO.
some random names, i won't need.
Js is Case Sensitive. so 'A' and 'a' are different.
True True. price != Price. for name
camelCase. This is how variables Described and bestPractice.

### 14 - Boolen
true
false

not (True or False), NOOO. cause Case Sensitive.
we can also change WHOLE VARIABLE TYPE ITSELF from Number to Boolen. (in Js ONLY, Not TS)

### 15 - WHAT IS TypeSCRIPT
Ts has STRICTER than Js for Types, We can't Change Whole Variable Type like Js.
 
### 16 - Practicing Stuff

### 17 - String in Js
using double quotes for string but single quote for single characters
bro when we need double quote in sentence then use single quote for String. 
so why that standard practice??? idk

### 18 - String Indices
string has position(index)
let name="heroMan";
name[2];
r 
this will get printed. 
it starts from 0


### 19 -
