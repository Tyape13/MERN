Ok Quick Scan Mode. 
Just New imp Concepts only writing.

from now there is no value probably for anyone looking on this Repo. i will write things that is only new to me. so me going Efficient Mode.
Thank You.

### 1 - console.log
yeah


### 2 - how to link with html file re
<script src="app.js"> </script>
when on same path. 
i think we could also do "./app.js"
but idk sometimes when i try to connect different components from navbar again n again it goes ../../ and path goes wrong i need to learn that. 


### 3 - Template Literals
`` - this stupid thing beside number 1 in keyboard is called BACK TICK.
we use '+' except ',' comma cause it's Js not Python connecting string in console.

Use ful function xa. 
`${variableName + variable2} will be added not in double/single quotes`
using: 
"${}" inside back tick.

### 4 - Operators in Js
Arithmetic
Unary
Assignment
Comparison (= is assignment so ')
Logical


### 5 - Comparison Operators
>
>= 
<=
== 
!=
This is it.

"TRIPLE Equals to" Operator
=== Compares Type & VALUE BOTH
while "Double equals to" compares Value not Type. 
so, 2 == "2" is True.
Javascript Typical.

0 == ' ' 
0 == false
null == undefined
these are all true
but when we use === then it'everything is false.

### 6 - comparison not for numbers
each character is based on ascii code. a>b this works and is false. i think


### 7 - Conditional Statement
if-else
nested if-else
switch
i know.


### 8 - if Statement
basic example.

### 9 - practice questions
about traffic light


### 10 - else if statement
we have elif in python i think idk.
so in JS
we have:

if{
    //
}
else if{
    // nice
}
else{
    // i know how things works
}

we mostly use '===' in js. 

### 11 - else statement
yeah

### 12 - practice Qs
popcorn pricing related problem.

### 13 - nested if
as expected, nested if is just if inside if.
if (this){
    if (nice){

    }
    else
    {
        //what
    }
}
else{
    //bruh
}
i mean to say Nested if isn't a keyword.

### 14 - Logical Operator
We have 'and' in python so in JS we have '&&'
Logical AND - '&&' 
Logical OR - '||'
Logical NOT - '!'


### 15 - Practice Qs
yeah

### 16 - truthy & falsy
Everything is treated as true or false but value itself might be different
like: 
1 or any number is true while 0 is false when using if statement. 
same with string, jaba string hunxa it's true while if string has nothing inside it's false. 
i know that.



### 17 - Switch statement
it won't be used that much just for concept if used in any diffeernt way.

same way to make things work.

let color = "red";
switch (color) {
    case "red":
        console.log('stop');
        break;
    case "yellow":
        console.log('Slow Down');
        break;
    case "Green":
        console.log('Go');
        break;
    default: 
        console.log("Broken Light");
}

this is the example i had in video.
if no break 

### 18 - Practice Qs
using case for number i think.

### 19 - Alert & Prompts. 
We not using this every cause it looks so bad. 
but using like:
`alert("herhonda ki Jay ho");`
`console.error("This is error");`
`console.warn("This is warning Message");`

Prompts has input box:
`prompt("Enter your name");`
this looks so bad. dog shit.
