HELL YEAH. Somewhat Different than Pure Html stuff.
let's Learn. HECKKK YEAH.

### 1 - Introduction
html is structure
Css is Styling, Coloring, texture, cover, MAKEUPPPP HECK YEAHH MAKEUPPPPP. 
No need to Remember Everything, Just Fundamentals and Aru Code Herda I need to be able to understand WORKINGS. that's it.

### 2 - Basic Format of CSS
h1{ /* this is selector that we use to select EVERY OTHER h1 Tag*/
    color:red;
    /* property: value */
}

### 3 - how to Link Css with Html
3 methods -
first: 
inline - used for 1 tag can't use for scale. like:
- style="color:red; background-color: yellow"
inside some <tag style="asd:asd; hehe:haha;"> />

second way:
<style>
    h1{
        color:red;
    }
</style>
yeah we put this in html file in header tira.
for just 1 html lai matrai hunxa.

third way:
External Css file and link it using ref??
nooo, "link" tag.
- <link rel="stylesheet" href="./path/style.css">

### 4 - Color property

color: #ffffff;
color: rbg(123,123,123);

### 10 - Text Properties
text-align: center;
font-weight: bold;
text-decoration: underline;
line-height: 2px;
letter-spacing: 2px;
font-size: xx-large;
---
Parent Element Bare Concepts. like document whole page ko right ma haina Parent Element ko relative ma things works. RELATIVE WORKING MECHANISMMMMMMMMMMMMM MMMMM AAPAPAPAPAPAPAP MMMMMM APAPAPPAPAPAP MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.
text-align can be right but "width:50%" makes it look like it's on center
"border:solid" makes us see things.

text-align: left/start;
text-align: right/end; for arabic languages.
center - center ma more text focused.
justify - this dynamically puts spaces in middle.


### 11 - Font Weight
I See. 
I don't need to write stuff i just need to know what this does and 
I know how structure works. that's it. 
- range goes from 100-900
text-decoration: underline, overline, line-through.
line-through is like DISCOUNT Price being cut.
line, dotted, double and color can also be changed.
text-decoration:none; 
we changed any anchor tag ko default underline to be gone.

### 12 - line-height or letter-spacing
line-height:normal;
line-height:2.5; //2.5 * normal
yeahhhhh!!! 

### 13 - UNITS in CSS
MOST IMPORTANT cause we learn about units and how it works.

Absolute   |    Relative
px         |    %
pt         |    em
pc         |    rem
cm         |    ch
mm         |    vh
in         |    vw + many more

96px = 1inch
72pt = 1in
12pt = 1 pc
We use 'px' alot so Remember PX.

%,em, rem, px. 
knowing this is enough.

px can't be on responsive website.
we use em, rem or % on mobile screen and desktop texts.

### 14 - font-family
NICE.
font ko style.
arial, times new roman.
we can put multiple font-family so it goes through list so browser goes to backup font if no support.

### 15 -
