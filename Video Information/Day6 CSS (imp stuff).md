1,2 showed how to download file stuff.

### 3 - Universal Selectors
we used to use like elements or tags as selecter like h1, p, textarea, select, option.
css have 3 things that makes structure works, 

selector{
    property:value;
}

* - selects everything as selector

---

### 4 - Element Selector
tag selector. but major Parent Tag that has collection of other tags is Element.
h1, h3 {
    property:value;
}

---

### 5 - Id selector

#id {
    property:value;
}

id name we put is case-sensitive so value of id attribute, we have on html tag needs to be same.

#signup {
    background-color: red;
    color: white;
}

Brooo Yetii ko lagi maile sala ai lai harrase nai gareko xu mula kassammm. sale lai runai lako thyo ai testo gali garya thy maile. lol.

### 6 - Class Selector

.classname {
    property: value;
}

### 7 - practice question
idk bro. 
ok i care cause new concept.

it says we can use css using this style but bro do i need this??? idk

div[id="myId"] p {
    color:green;
}

#myId p {
    property: value;
}

hmmmm first one is just those divs that has id that while second one might select every one right??? idk not trying that right now.
yeah only 'p' tag inside 'div' tag.

---

### 8 - Descendant Selector
Bro we used this above... that's why it mattered cause i didn't know but i know it's imp. see me genuis turtle. bruh.

}
