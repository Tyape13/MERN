Ok.... me just want to quick scan css stuff...
Ok Me Write New Important Major Concept like GRID

### 1 - Grid
grid container can have grid items.
display:grid;
ok display:flex had default axis row.
but grid has column as main axis when div occupies whole row and collection of divs gives you column wala boxes.

### 9 - Animations in CSS
To animate Css Elements.
animation is just Transition but with More Control.
remember how we couldn't change transition to both border-radius and margin-top.....

@keyframes RandomAnimationName {
    from { font-size: 20px }
    to { font-size: 40px }
}

this is template, like a function that needs to be called.

We need to write "@keyframes" to make that function of Animation.
things to know:
animation-name
animation-duration
animation-timing-function : ease-in-out;
animation-delay
animation-iteration-count : infinite (how many times);
animation-direction : normal/reverse/alternate/alternate-re;

For Optimized Website:
Bro, i think....Ai won't know what css  values are making this page look nice and will kep everything and just add more n more css to make file larger and larger. 
So me really need to be able to optimize website i need to be able to ... take the first css file then make manual changes myself or if we let ai do it it will keep adding more n more properties that will overrule and just a BIG CSS FILE with Affects OVERWRITING EACH OTHER to get final decent one that we want.

### 10 - Animation Shorthand
animation: RandomAnimationName 3s ease-in 0s infinite normal;
yes shortcut to calling the function but we do need @keyframes.


### 11 - Percentage in Animation
Broo i wanted to know how it worked back in my old days.

@keyframes RandomName{
    0% {font-size: 20px; }
    50% {font-size: 30px; }
    80% {background-color: pink; }
    100% {font-size: 40px; }
}

rather than using "from" and "to" we are going to use this percetage system.

### 12 - Media Queries
!important
Helps create Responsive Website using:
"@media"
orientation or width/height or anything other ko according div changing WHOLE....WOTTTT

@media(width: 400px){
    div {
        background-color:red;
    }
}

at exactly 400px!!! bruh. 

ohh we need to use
min-width:400px; for desktop we using some 
max-width:1200px; // for mobile maximum kati hola tesko properties defining.

@media (min-width:300px) and (max-width: 900px) {
    background-color: pink; 
}


### 13 - media Orientations

@media(orientation:landscape){

}

### 14 - Pet Adoption Practicing.
...

### 15 - some random pdf

### 16 - z-index
this is what makes that pet mascot up. and others to be down
or like those navbar that has fixed position and z-index above other content.
nice.
