### 3 - Google Fonts
Some Fonts will be at my system but not at User System.
So we need to use Google Fonts.
    'fonts.google.com'
go this website, then copy link of font that you want to use and paste it in head tag of html.
then use font-family in css to use that font.
importing all makes css huge and inefficient.
then go to css file and use as it's said in website.

### 4 - Icons
same font.google.com kai website ma we can also find icons.
SO ELEGANTTTTT LOOKING ICONS. BEAUTIFUL
then paste link of font in head tag of html

another website:
"font awesome"
we go to cdnjs.com then there is font-awesome ko icons we have to provide in link of head tag of html.
then use as it's said.
