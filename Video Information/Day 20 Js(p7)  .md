i need to pull there and not mess with the code.

### 1 - 'this' keyword
this keyword is used to refer to the current object.
any 


### 2 - try & catch
levelled up programming concept. 


### 3 - Random Topics
Arrow Function - it's just shorter re. it's nameless function assigned to variable but using arrow than 'function' keyword.
high order function ma parameter jasari pass garna?? bruh normal ma pani hunxa haina by Returning Function itself. 
But I m now FAMILIAR with this Weird Looking Code, it's Just Function. 

WE USE ARROW FUNCTION as VALUE, just Readibility better hunxa. it's value of the variable. 

CALLBACK - it's just Higher Order Function taking A FUNCTION. that Function is called Callback.
CALLBACK is FUNCTION that gets passed as ARGUMENT in HIGHER ORDER FUNCTION.


### 5 - setTimeout(callback, time);
hah
YOU NEED TO SEE EXAMPLE

# IMPORTANT_NEW_CONCEPT

### 7 - how 'this' behaves on               
'this' on normal function: SCOPE depends on calling function,
'this' on Arrow Function:  LEXICAL Scope, nested function variable wala concept but idk exactly k ho
arrow function ko PARENT lai Josle Call Gareko, this refers to that OBJECT.




// Explanation starts here. 
'func' called as -> "obj.func" like -> student.getName() so -> 'this'='student'

but for arrow func, this goes to one who calls it's parents. 
Arrow will DIRECTLY MOVE TO DEAL WITH the ONE WHO CALLED HIS PARENTS.
ARROW Cares about his Parents and Will Directly Deal with the one Pulling String to his Parents. 
Arrow is MEGA CHAD.
so,

'arrow_func' gets called by parents as same way like -> 'obj.arrow_func' like -> student.getMarks() 
but 'student' Object is Parent of Arrow, so Arrow see his PARENT 'student' Object is Being Called by WINDOWS so it's this is 'Windows' so it's {}. 

I think pahila it used to show 'windows' but it nowdays shows nothin.

let's try this theory.
