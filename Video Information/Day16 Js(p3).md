Let's go.


### 1 - String Methods
method is just "console.log()"
this log is method. Hmmmmmm. nice nice.
parenthesis having means Method xa, 
idk string.length is method but function or something. IDK bro.

### 2 - Str.trim()
it will trim white spaces from ONLY FROM EXTREME Side. Not InBetween
like removing spaces from password and saving it.


### 3 - String are immutable
can't change 
string[2] = 's';
only full value can be changed not 1 specific part.

### 4 - str.toUpperCase() str.toLowerCase()
yeah idk if value itself changes or we get return of uppercased string. 
IDK neither do i care.


### 5 - string method with arguments
string.method(arg)
hmm parenthesis vitra argument ma value passing.
example:
idnexOf
str.indexOf("Hero");
// 0 dinxa probably.
hmm searches whole phrase then gives index of where it starts from.
if doesn't have then 
// -1 dinxa.

### 6 -  Method Chaining
str.toUpperCase().trim()
this is it.

Bruh i though we couldn't use comma(,) while joining string with variables as in python but console.log('nice', variable); works for some reason.


### 7 - slice method
st.slice(5) /gives everything from 5th index
str.slice(1,4) // start, ending
str.slice(-num) = str.slice(length-num)
hmm same as python huh

### 8 - replace method in string
str.replace('love', 'RUN BRO RUNNNNN'); 
// this will find first word and replace with second one.
Bro No NEED to know these things.
sigh*


### 9 - Practice Qs
whateva

### 10 - Array (Data Structure)
array haru ko bare ma so many things.

11 12 13 tira. 
concatenation and Reverse haru chalerako xa

### 22 - Arrays References
This means, ADDRESS IN MEMORY. remembered concept in python where array each elements have first address then next element have just 1 number change in address.
"name" == "name"
true
[1] == [1]
false
cause array address is on different place. array elements can be same but whole array is different so we need to compare each elements.
let arr = [1,2,3];
let arrCopy = arr;
now if we change arrCopy then it will change arr also.
cause Both Variables pointing to same address array.

### 23 - constant array
const arr = [1,2,3];
now we can change and update array.
BUT NOT AS WHOLE, like we can't assign different array in this variable of this array.
but we can update re.
cause when we assign completely different array it changes the whole adress i think.

### 24 - Nested Arrays
yes exactly what i think
