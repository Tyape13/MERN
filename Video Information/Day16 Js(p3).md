Let's go.


### 1 - String Methods
method is just "console.log()"
this log is method. Hmmmmmm. nice nice.
parenthesis having means Method xa, 
idk string.length is method but function or something. IDK bro.

### 2 - Str.trim()
it will trim white spaces from ONLY FROM EXTREME Side. Not InBetween
like removing spaces from password and saving it.


### 3 - String are immutable
can't change 
string[2] = 's';
only full value can be changed not 1 specific part.

### 4 - str.toUpperCase() str.toLowerCase()
yeah idk if value itself changes or we get return of uppercased string. 
IDK neither do i care.


### 5 - string method with arguments
string.method(arg)
hmm parenthesis vitra argument ma value passing.
example:
idnexOf
str.indexOf("Hero");
// 0 dinxa probably.
hmm searches whole phrase then gives index of where it starts from.
if doesn't have then 
// -1 dinxa.

### 6 -  Method Chaining
str.toUpperCase().trim()
this is it.

Bruh i though we couldn't use comma(,) while joining string with variables as in python but console.log('nice', variable); works for some reason.


### 7 - slice method
st.slice(5) /gives everything from 5th index
str.slice(1,4) // start, ending
str.slice(-num) = str.slice(length-num)
hmm same as python huh

### 8 - replace method in string
str.replace('love', 'RUN BRO RUNNNNN'); 
// this will find first word and replace with second one.
Bro No NEED to know these things.
sigh*


### 9 - Practice Qs

### 10 - Array (Data Structure)
