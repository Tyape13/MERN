idk bro more css stuff. I will just write new concepts or fundamental working mechanism stuff.

### 1 - Alpha & Opacity is different....What
rgba(255,255,255,0.5)
if we put 0 it's black cause mixing everything is White but they won't matter cause opacity 0 so black.

Opacity is Different, It Affects Everything inside that Element.
while alpha is just for color. 
so if alpha for background-color is transparent or gone, then we can still see text for alpha 
but Opacity Hides everything.

### 2 - Transitions (imp)
when we hover, whole element can FLOAT with Shadows. - Transition

```
transition: margin-top 2s ease-in-out 0.2s;
property name | duration | timing-function | delay;
```
delay property is it will wait for that seconds before Transitioning.

could only use 1 property-name that we would likt it to affect while transitioning.

### 3-6 (Transform)
we could do:
rotate, 
scale, 
skew, 
translate

transform: rotate(-45deg);
transform: scale(1.5, 2);       /* x, y */
transform: translate(50px, 40px); /* slide gareko x,y */
transform: skew(30deg);         /* rectangle lai parallelogram banaidinxa */
transform: rotate(20deg) translate(190px); 

Not Necessary to Remember unless i m Full time Frontend Designer but just to know these things exists.


### 7 - Box Shadow ( Important when Hovering Stuff)
box-shadow: 2px 2px 10px green;
- x dekhi, y dekhi, blurr radius, color


### 8 - Background Image
background-image: url("../path/img.jpg"); /* zoomed hunxa or Blurred hunxa sala*/
background-size : contain/cover/auto;

contain - can't crop, can't scale but repeat
cover - crop but can't scale
auto - scale to fit things.

it will make it like background image and we can put any form or any text or anything in this div.

### 9 - Card Hover Effect (IMP Video)
div ko height, width something.

img{
    width: 100%
}
this will make image contain inside the div.

display: inline-block;
ok we will do GOLDEN SHADOW FOR COMBO PRODUCT but Black Shadow for Normal Product.


### 10 - Position
This will tell, How ELEMENT is Positioned in a Document.
Top, Right, Bottom, Left.
- static
- relative
- absolute
- fixed
i think we used this in that pet stuff. idk

Static - Default value
I can Play Around with these things. 
"Sticky" ho ki k pani xa. Property or something

### 11 - Simple Smiley Face
Just Some Example Haru, Nothing else. 


This is It. 
Lets' Move On. I M FUCKING SERIOUSLY FOCUSED RIGHT NOW. I need to LOCK THE FUCK IN. Let's Go Brother. I KNOW.
